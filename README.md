#Custom Firefox Userchrome for use with Sidebery Extension

A userChrome.css file that disables the Firefox tab bar and creates a narrow sidebar on the left side of the screen. When you hover over the sidebar, it expands. If used with the [Sidebery](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) extension, it is an elegant and efficient way to display your tabs. 

##Installation
Install the Sidebery extension. Put 'userChrome.css' in your 'Chrome' folder. ([More info](https://www.userchrome.org/)) Copy and paste the contents of 'sidebery.css' into the 'styles editor' section of the Sidebery settings page. Completely close and reopen Firefox.
